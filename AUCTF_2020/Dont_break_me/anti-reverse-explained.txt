call $+5    call the next instruction
            push the next instruction addr on th stack
            stack : 0x1235
pop edi     load the first 4bytes on the stack into edi
            so edi = 0x1235

            # Those two instructions set edi to it's own instruciton's address

sub edi, 5  substract 5 from the addr, which become
            edi = 0x1230

            # The next loop is a "search" pointer for a brakpoint
            The binary is scanning itself for a breakpoint
            While the content of edi ([edi]) is not == to $al
            edi is incremented, and ecx decremented.
            ecx = 0x400
            eax = 0x0CC

            $al is the lowest 8 bites of $eax
            $al = 0xCC (which is the opcode for a breakpoint)

            So it scan itself from the address 0x1230 to 0x1230 + 0x400 = 0x1630
            If a breakpoint is found, it call the "DebuggerDetected function", which print "BAD"

            Since the function is call at every new function, the entier binary can cover itself.
