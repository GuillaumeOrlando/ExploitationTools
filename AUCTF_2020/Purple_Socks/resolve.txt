xor key: N

Binary xored with 'N' (or 0x4e) : I tested the ELF header blindly against a valid ELF Header, and it works
Xor but zeroes are still zeros

See decipher.py for the details on how to retreive the plaintext file
Anyway, it gave us a nice ELF that is asking for an username and a password

simple strcmp
username: "bucky"
password: "longing, rusted, seventeen, daybreak, furnace, nine, benign, homecoming, one, freight car"

found the remote access inside the bin's strings:
URL: challenges.auctf.com, PORT: 30049

Simple jail, we can list the files: flag.txt
we can read file's content, but the flag is "password protected":
> [? for menu]: read
Usage: read <filename>
> [? for menu]: read flag.txt
This file is password protected ... 
You will have to enter the password to gain access
Password: 

encrypt() function is asking for the password, and is doing some weird shit with a seed and a secret of several bytes

pass.py for the algo reverse implementation !
