It seems that i have to create a script that will reverse this thing for me
Simple binary, with a repetition in it's design.

Take an input, and pass each chars of the user input inside a different function.
This function architecture is basicaly:
	int(input[n]) + somehting == somehting else

For instance, the first call to that function is:
   0x40323c <f992+8>:	mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
   0x403240 <f992+12>:	add    rax,0x62
   0x403244 <f992+16>:	movzx  eax,BYTE PTR [rax]
=> 0x403247 <f992+19>:	cmp    al,0x30

add go to offset 0x62 of the input string and cmp it against 0x30.

see the script for more details
