'readelf -h patcherman' give something odd:
By looking at the elf header, we can see that the section table address is nulled out !
This can be found at offset 30 (int). 

I compared the header of a valid file against our malformated file's header: 

[root@Arch Patcherman]# xxd ../Taking_Off/taking_off | head -20
7f45 4c46 0201 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000 (elf header)
02 00 (e_type)
3e 00 (e_machine)
01 00  (e_version)
00 00 90 07 40 00 00 00 (entrypoint)
00 00 40 00 00 00 00 00 (e_phoff)
00 00 00 2c 00 00 00 00 (section header table address)

0000 0000 2c00 0000

===================================================================

'xxd patcherman'
I found the begining of the header section at 0x1B00 (you can grep for '.bss' and go at the end of the string table)

[root@Arch Patcherman]# xxd patcherman | head -20
7f45 4c46 0201 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000 (elf header)
02 00 (e_type)
3e 00 (e_machine)
01 00 (e_version)
00 00 70 05 40 00 00 00 (entrypoint)
00 00 40 00 00 00 00 00 (e_phoff)
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 (section header table address) <- Nulled out !!

should be: 0000 0000 1b00 0000

replaced the line with: 00 00 00 1b 00 00 00 00 (little-indian)

The specific offset of the binary is then patched by hand, in order to be able to open it with ID / gdb
Step 1 completed !

By looking onto the binary's instruction, it look like that it is also looking for a hardcoded value.
In order to go further, the 'serial' variable (that is initialized with 0xF00DBABE) need to be patch to 0x1337BEEF.
It is a static variable, so we can found it in the .data section, at the offset 0x601050.

A quick verification with xxd confirme the offset address.
'xxd patcherman | grep "beba"' (little indian for the "babe" string in 0xF00DBABE)
00001050: beba 0df0 ff00 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000  ................

Again, a quick and dirty patch by hand on this offset, with the value: 0xefbe3713 (little-indian)

And it's a flag:
[root@Arch Patcherman]# ./patcherman
Here have a flag:
actf{p4tch3rm4n_15_n0_m0r3}
